# cake-for-comics
A simple webcomic-specific CMS, built as an extension of CakePHP 3.0+, intended for non-coder artists.

This is my "learn-to-GitHub" project, so initial progress will be slow and noobish as I figure out how to set up the project in an elegant, easily extendable way. A lot of the working code is already written and in use for my own comic site (http://sscelia.com/) but isn't especially repackageable or reusable and needs refactoring.
